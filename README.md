Cosmo Components is a library that provides better React components,
including inputs, buttons, and a high level version of React.Component class that has an 
improved lifecycle that gets rid of redundant state deriving and re-rendering.

All cosmo components extend the Cosmo_Logger class from the [Cosmo Utils Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pixel-forge/cosmo-utils) that provides
better logging in the console, with stylizing based on the log level system, and grouping for clear log hierarchy.
